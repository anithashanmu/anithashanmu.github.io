           <h1>What to Experience</h1>
           The whole point of visiting Vancouver in the winter is the experience, and this city is prepped and primed with the very best activities. The theory that Canada freezes over is a myth, particularly for Vancouver as it has one of the mildest climates in the country. While the nearby mountains get doused with enough powder to keep skiers happy, the streets stay clear enough for you to comfortably walk around. So, the question then is this , what's first on the agenda?

            To make the most of the outdoors, start by taking the short 20-minute trip to the North Shore. Here you'll find the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, along with its twinkling Treetops Adventure and the thrilling Cliffwalk experience. Wandering through cedar-scented rainforest, you can brave the bridge dangling 110 feet above the forest floor, then continue up to Grouse Mountain where even more magic awaits.

            The Peak of Christmas event takes place annually over the holidays, and a private snowshoe and fondue tour is the perfect way to kick things off. After adventuring through sparkling snow-topped trees and along pristine trails you'll indulge in ooey-gooey cheese, decadent chocolate or even a broth pot of fondue. If you plan on visiting Vancouver outside of the Peak of Christmas, Grouse Mountain still offers lots of seasonal activities, including the very same snowshoe and fondue tours and night skiing or snowboarding , a must-do for mountain sports enthusiasts!

            Back in the city, downtown is alive with activity. Shop through the boutiques of Gastown and Yaletown or for designer labels on Alberni, or continue your nature fix with a walk or bicycle ride through Stanley Park. Occupying an enormous 400 hectares on the western side of Downtown Vancouver, you can take your pick of trails or side with the seawall, and enjoy a beautiful display of lights as the evening closes in.

            Finish things off with a trip to the Vancouver Christmas Market or ride with Flyover Canada, then save an entire afternoon to enjoy a day at the spa. Rosewood Sense Spa, Willow Stream Spa, the Spa at the Wedgewood and CHI, The Spa are all luxurious options that will leave you melting with relaxation, readying you for another day in Vancouver's winter wonderland.
