                <b>Early life and career</b><br>
                Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[3] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.<br>
                <i>He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.</i>
                He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father.<br>
                His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas and was mostly of English descent, though in <2007> 
                it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in 1850.<br>
                In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[9][10] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[11][12] was a married[13][14][15] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[13][16] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[17][18] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.

            <p>
                Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. 
                The main reforms include: the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as "the ACA" or "Obamacare", the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. 
                The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing in Yemen of al-Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki, who was an American citizen. He ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the counterterrorism raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
